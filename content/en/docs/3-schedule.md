Each week involves completing to the best of your ability a series of exercises; you will document your progress in a weekly log that you will keep online. Log entries are required to be completed by the Sunday evening at the end of the relevant work. A final reflection piece is due at the end of the course. See the [assessment page for further details](docs/4-assessment)
