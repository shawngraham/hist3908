### Questions

I developed this course with a couple of questions in mind, things I wanted to know the answers to.

_This course is a formalized exploration of these questions; I do not know the answers! I'm excited to figure these out with you._

+ How has the language of Ottawa's aspirations changed over time? Why?
+ How and why has the urban image of Ottawa changed over time?
+ Many cities around the world are using the present moment to re-think how they work, what they could be. What lessons from Ottawa's past imagined futures can we draw for our present future?

### Outcomes

1.  TODO
2.  TODO  
3.  TODO

### Texts

See the [weekly work](/week) section. All readings are open access.

### Real Names Policy

You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me that you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:

‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’

…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.

### When Life Intervenes

There's nothing we can't roll with, in this class. That said, it is a compressed time frame: so if something comes up, just let me know:

{{< notice success "Important" >}} You don't have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.
{{< /notice >}}

When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can **figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here**. It's our course - we can change things up as we need to.
