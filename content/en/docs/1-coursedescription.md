### HIST3908o Fall 2020 Department of History, Carleton University

Why Cities? Why Ottawa? Urban living, when viewed cross-culturally and across the evolution of our species, is a very recent development. How did urban systems evolve? What have been the consequences for how we live our lives, how we imagine what our lives could be? How have we imagined cities? This course draws on archaeology, history, urban geography, and other disciplines to explore the broader history of human urbanism with reference to the city we know best, Ottawa. As a capital city, Ottawa has long been subject to 'official plans' and other attempts to project a kind of vision of the city. We will explore these imagined Ottawas through digital humanities' approaches, amongst others. The goal is to learn how to read the effects of humanity's urban history in the social/physical/biological/political fabric of our current cities, to set us up to imagine better cities in the future.

**You do not need to be 'techy' to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open.**

You will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) and [Github](http://github.com) (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. Successful completion of this class involves doing a series of exercises each week designed to push you out of your comfort zone, AND to be a collegial and generous scholar engaging with, and helping your peers to achieve success. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. **You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.**

## Class format
This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on an open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures. Students will maintain open course research notebooks on the web (which may be anonymous or pseudonymous).
