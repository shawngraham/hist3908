## Getting our feet wet

Annotate anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is in our group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read. Share anything interesting you've found in our social space. A handy getting-started approach to annotation is to think of the three W's: the weird, the wonderful, the worrying. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.


### Do

- Follow the instructions for [Setting Up Github](/week/1/github), [Setting up Hypothesis](/week/1/hypothesis), [Setting up Zotero](/week/1/zotero), and [asking for help](/week/1/help). You should read the [discord page](/week/1/discord) if you're new to that platform.
- Log your reflection in your appropriate github repository

- When/if you run into trouble, take screenshots (google how to do that for your particular machine) and these can be uploaded into your repository as well. Indeed, you should also keep track of any files you create as part of your weekly work in your repo: these are evidence!

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
