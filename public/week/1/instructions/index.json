If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. \u0026lsquo;Git\u0026rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull notice, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button:  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward create a new repository for each week\u0026rsquo;s work/reflection. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nSetting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. You might want to go ahead now and create repositories for week 2 through to week 6. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo:  If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. In my example, that would be week-two. On a PC, right-click on the folder and select \u0026lsquo;open a command prompt here\u0026rsquo;. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;. Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? Type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report.  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  Going further Github can also be used to run an entire website, generated from your text files. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how I built this course website! The following three links are from my HIST4806a 2020 seminar on digital history and museums; they will walk you through how to use your Github account to serve up a professional scholarly website; you can use this scholarly website to host your reflections and course work, if you want.

Why Ottawa? Urban living, when viewed cross-culturally and across the evolution of our species, is a very recent development. How did urban systems evolve? What have been the consequences for how we live our lives, how we imagine what our lives could be? How have we imagined cities? This course draws on archaeology, history, urban geography, and other disciplines to explore the broader history of human urbanism with reference to the city we know best, Ottawa. As a capital city, Ottawa has long been subject to \u0026lsquo;official plans\u0026rsquo; and other attempts to project a kind of vision of the city. We will explore these imagined Ottawas through digital humanities\u0026rsquo; approaches, amongst others. The goal is to learn how to read the effects of humanity\u0026rsquo;s urban history in the social/physical/biological/political fabric of our current cities, to set us up to imagine better cities in the future.\nYou do not need to be \u0026lsquo;techy\u0026rsquo; to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open. You will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including Hypothes.is and Github (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. Successful completion of this class involves doing a series of exercises each week designed to push you out of your comfort zone, AND to be a collegial and generous scholar engaging with, and helping your peers to achieve success. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nClass format This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on an open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures. Students will maintain open course research notebooks on the web (which may be anonymous or pseudonymous).\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":10,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1.

I\u0026rsquo;m excited to figure these out with you.\n How has the language of Ottawa\u0026rsquo;s aspirations changed over time? Why? How and why has the urban image of Ottawa changed over time? Many cities around the world are using the present moment to re-think how they work, what they could be. What lessons from Ottawa\u0026rsquo;s past imagined futures can we draw for our present future?  Outcomes  TODO TODO TODO  Texts See the weekly work section. All readings are open access.\nReal Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me that you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, it is a compressed time frame: so if something comes up, just let me know:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.\r When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here.

There is no final exam.\r Weekly Work Evidence Therefore, I am looking for the following kinds of evidence (each week will specify what needs to be done):\n logs that keep track of what you actually tried reflection on that process engagement with the materials and your classmates (which might be demonstrated many different ways) evidence for your growth as a historian over this course  At the end of each week, you will provide to me through a form that can be found on each weekly page the links to your evidence for me to consider, by Sunday evening.\nI will return feedback to you within two or three days. I will write you a note giving you my perspective on what you\u0026rsquo;ve done (using the lens of the learning outcomes), and offering advice. Your weekly work will be assessed as \u0026lsquo;satisfactory\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;unsatisfactory\u0026rsquo;.\nThis feedback will also be mapped against the learning outcomes, so that you know how you are progressing throughout the course.\nThe Exit Ticket You will produce an \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you\u0026rsquo;ve done against the learning outcomes. The exit ticket is a summary assessment exercise that will pull all the different strings together into a strong cord. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.\nYour final grade isn\u0026rsquo;t based on getting something \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s based on your own assessment of your own journey.\r If you\u0026rsquo;ve never done digital work before, it might be that you never quite manage to get as many of the tech things working as you might\u0026rsquo;ve wanted: but you now know what you didn\u0026rsquo;t know before. That\u0026rsquo;s a win. You might be a computer science minor and the tech materials don\u0026rsquo;t present you with much challenge: but figuring out how to tell the compelling story was very difficult for you but you\u0026rsquo;re better at it now. Your \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.\nIf I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive. When I have disagreed in previous courses this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to raise the grade: y\u0026rsquo;all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you\u0026rsquo;ve overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.\nThe Exit Ticket should be submitted by the last day of the early summer term. If you should require more time, you need merely to let me know; no questions asked.\nGrading Remembering the learning outcomes,\n   Learning Outcome A B C D eg. Joe Q Student     1. analytical ability - - - - X   2. methodology - - - - -   3. collaboration - - - - X   4. argumentation - - - - X   5. professionalization - - - - -    \u0026hellip;5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.\nIn this example, based on my consideration of Joe Q Student\u0026rsquo;s evidence and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;d written him over the six weeks, it seemed to me that he did what he needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C. However, his exit ticket might bring him up. Percentage Breakdown I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown.\nWeekly work = 80%\nFinal Exit ticket = 20%\nI reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.\n","description":"grading and ungrading","id":13,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"4.

You don\u0026rsquo;t have to do this alone!\n(Featured image by Paolo Candelo)\n","description":"","id":14,"section":"blog","tags":null,"title":"And We're Off!","uri":"https://hist3908.netlify.com/blog/update1/"},{"content":"The following are the University regulations common to all History courses.\r COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses.\nPLAGIARISM The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include:\n reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source; submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else; using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; using another’s data or research findings; failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks; handing in \u0026ldquo;substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs.\u0026rdquo;  Plagiarism is a serious offence which cannot be resolved directly with the course’s instructor. The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; for the course.\nCOURSE SHARING WEBSITES and COPYRIGHT To the degree that I am able, all original content on this course website is released under creative commons licensed.

Carleton University Equity Services states that \u0026lsquo;every member of the University community has a right to study, work and live in a safe environment free of discrimination or harassment\u0026rsquo;. [In May of 2001 Carleton University’s Senate and Board of Governors approved the Carleton University Human Rights Policies and Procedures. The establishment of these policies and procedures was the culmination of the efforts of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human Rights and a Human Rights Implementation Committee.]\nGRADING SYSTEM Letter grades assigned in this course will have the following percentage equivalents:\n   Grade        A+ = 90-100 (12) B = 73-76 (8) C - = 60-62 (4) F= 0-49 (0) – Failure: no academic credit   A = 85-89 (11) B - = 70-72 (7)\tD+ = 57-59 (3)    A - = 80-84 (10) C+ = 67-69 (6) D = 53-56 (2)    B+ = 77-79 (9) C = 63-66 (5) D - = 50-52 (1)     The following additional final course grades may be assigned by instructors:\nDEF Official deferral of final exam (see \u0026ldquo;Petitions to Defer\u0026rdquo;)\nGNA Grade not available. This is used when there is an allegation of an academic offence. The notation is replaced with the appropriate grade for the course as soon as it is available.\nIP\tIn Progress – a notation (IP) assigned to a course by a faculty member when: At the undergraduate level, an undergraduate thesis or course has not been completed by the end of the period of registration.\nWDN\tWithdrawn. No academic credit, no impact on the CGPA. WDN is a permanent notation that appears on the official transcript for students who withdraw after the full fee adjustment date in each term (noted in the Academic Year section of the Calendar each term). Students may withdraw on or before the last day of classes.\nStanding in a course is determined by the course instructor subject to the approval of the Faculty Dean. This means that grades submitted by the instructor may be subject to revision. No grades are final until they have been approved by the Dean.\nWITHDRAWAL WITHOUT ACADEMIC PENALTY September 30, 2020: Last day for a full fee adjustment (financial withdrawal). Withdrawals after this date will result in a permanent notation of WDN on the official transcript.\nDecember 11, 2020: Last day for academic withdrawal.\nREQUESTS FOR ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS You may need special arrangements to meet your academic obligations during the term. For an accommodation request the processes are as follows:\nPregnancy obligation: write to the professor with any requests for academic accommodation during the first two weeks of class, or as soon as possible after the need for accommodation is known to exist.

Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo;, on first blush. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball. Afterall, to mix sporting metaphors, you\u0026rsquo;re here for icetime not the Stanley Cup.\nOn another note, this course originally was intended to be a kind of hybrid course, blending face to face work in the classroom with resources and digital tools.\nThat of course, can\u0026rsquo;t happen at the moment.\nMoving online just means that I have to work harder at fostering the social aspect of learning and education.\nSocial Contact Another problem with moving fully online is isolation. Working with digital tools and environments, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re not overly familiar with how they work - or even the underlying metaphors that would help you make sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on - is frustrating. Bad enough when you have classmates you see twice a week and can at least complain with over coffee later; extremely awful when you\u0026rsquo;re on a bad internet connection and everyone thinks that you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing schoolwork.\nIn past classes, I have used Slack as a way of trying to meet that need for human connection that makes learning meaningful. It worked, more or less, but if there was a conversation going on and you missed part of it, it could just feel overwhelming and impenetrable.\nAnd it was one more damned thing to install. One more damned thing to get a password for.\nI tried Zulipchat another year. Same problem again.\nThis year, as I write this, I\u0026rsquo;m trying Discord, for its voice and screensharing integration. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes.\nDigital History is a team sport. You are never expected to power through all of this material on your own in heroic scholarly endeavour. If you need help, ask for help; if you can help, offer it. You are not alone.\r This website is built using Hugo, a static site builder. Static sites are quicker, more secure, and separate content from container, thus making them more sustainable. I write all of the content in individual text files, which I can then turn into whatever output - html, pdf, word doc - that I need. My writing is freed from subscription-based software that might lock it in. I push all of the text files onto github (you can see them here.) Then, I have netlify.com watch those files for any changes. When it spots changes, it uses Hugo to turn them into html, and serves them up to the world.\nThe Parliament Centre Block building logo is by Adam Lin, at The Noun Project.\n","description":"how the course tech is built; how the course came to be","id":17,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"7.

Instructions will seem vague or incomplete - or worse, I will have indeed forgotten to tell you something crucial.\nOr worse, I\u0026rsquo;ve made an assumption about your understanding, and left things unsaid that needed to be made explicit. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of this, in the digital world, in fact.\nThis week, you learned a bit about Git and Github. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at a question on the q-and-a site, \u0026lsquo;Stackoverflow\u0026rsquo; here. Just scroll through that question, and look at some of the answers. Make a note of any terms or code or responses that make not an ounce of sense to you.\nIt can make you feel rather overwhelmed, rather quickly. And like most places on the internet, StackOverflow has its own culture, its own norms of expression and behaviour. People who are new can get roasted. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons we have our own discord server, and a private reading group on Hypothesis: these are places for you to ask for help from a community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from because we\u0026rsquo;re all in the same headspace.\nSo, when things go wrong, the first thing to do is to find the community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from. I read and search StackOverflow all the time, but I rarely ask questions there. Instead, I write to trusted colleagues. And they in turn write to me.\nBut there are a couple of things we can do to make life easier.\nAsking good questions StackOverflow does have good advice on asking good questions. I will excerpt some of their advice:\n Write a title that summarizes the specific problem\u0026hellip; If you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.\n  Introduce the problem before you post any code [or a screenshot or a video clip]\u0026hellip;start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself.\n  Help others reproduce the problem [SG: post the code, post a screenshot, post a video clip walk through]\n Please do this.\nEvery term, I receive dozens of emails with the subject line \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; and the message body \u0026lsquo;i tried it and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;. Sometimes, the message will also say \u0026lsquo;i worked on it for 3 hrs and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;.\nNone of that is helpful. Telling me that you worked on it for 3 hours just shows me that you ignored my messages about \u0026lsquo;if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come after 30 minutes, take a break, ask for help\u0026rsquo;. So - let\u0026rsquo;s practice right now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to make a git mistake.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the situation:\n Imagine that you were working on your repo, wanting to update it from the command line - but you had to go away for a bit. When you come back, you discover your computer has run out of juice and shut down. Plugging it back in, none of your folders are open. You click on what you think is the right one and start to carry on\u0026hellip;.\n Right-click on any folder on your computer except the one(s) you created in the github exercise, and open a command prompt or a terminal there. Imagine I told you to commit your changes, like so: git commit -m \u0026quot;this is just a test\u0026quot;.\nDo that.\nWhat happened? Write a \u0026lsquo;help request\u0026rsquo;, using the guidelines above (and also include the page URL of any tutorial or thing you were trying to follow), with an indication of what you were trying to do, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened, and add it to your repo for this week in its own file. You may also post it in this week\u0026rsquo;s channel in Discord, introducing it with an appropriate title (eg, \u0026lsquo;Demo Help Request\u0026rsquo;). Feel free to respond to a request with eg \u0026lsquo;Demo Help Response\u0026rsquo;.\nWhen you have an actual help request, you can collect all of the information together, put it in a file in your repo, and share the link in discord or post the whole thing in the relevant channel.\nAnswering questions As the course progresses, you will have many opportunities to ask for help from me and from your peers - post these in our discord server in the appropriate channel.\nSometimes, you will see questions that you can answer. A few guidelines for answering questions:\n There are many different ways to solve these issues; someone might post a different way but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that either of you are necessarily wrong. Read the question carefully. Request clarification if there are bits that the original poster didn\u0026rsquo;t make clear - help them to ask better questions. Use screenshots and screenvideo (I find screencastomatic handy in this regard) to show how things worked for you. Provide links to useful relevant material if you know of it. Assume the best of everyone: not everyone has the same fluency with these machines, and it takes a while to learn the language.
